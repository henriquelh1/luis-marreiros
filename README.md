# Approach
 > <b>Mobile Automation</b>
 <p>The Mobile Automation for this project consists in testing a native mobile application. To this end, I used Appium, because it allows to work with any test script language, including Java the language used in this project. In addition to that, it is free and open source, supports both Android and IOS and the tests can be written using the same API. Junit was used to create a flow for the test execution with different annotations. It is possible to see its use especially in the class AppTest, where the test cases are defined. The entire structure of this suite was based on Page Object Model because it helps to reduce code duplication and enhance test maintenance too. 
</p>

<br>

 ><b>API Automation</b>
 <p>As a solution for the API Automation I have used Cypress, which is an end-to-end testing framework for web test automation. With Cypress we are able to write automated web tests in Javascript and its use brings some advantages, for example, we donâ€™t need to worry about synchronization between the code and the browser, because the wait for the DOM to load is done automatically. Another thing to mention is about debuggability, its readable errors and stack traces make debugging much easier and faster. If we compare with Selenium, we can notice how simple it is to set up and to use, and of course the time execution it is very fast too.
